1. Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how this application (“the Application”) collects, uses, and protects information when processing files uploaded by users for the purpose of generating reports.

The Application is intended for personal or internal use and is not a public consumer service.

2. Information Processed

The Application processes files provided directly by the user, which may include:

Credit card transaction slips or receipts

Transaction dates, amounts, and merchant information

Other information contained within the uploaded documents

The Application does not request or require users to provide information beyond what is contained in the files they choose to upload.

3. Use of Information

Information contained in uploaded files is used solely to:

Extract relevant transaction data

Generate summaries or reports for the user

Enable user-requested automation or analysis workflows

The data is not used for advertising, profiling, marketing, or analytics unrelated to the user’s request.

4. Data Storage and Retention

Uploaded files and extracted data are processed only for the duration necessary to generate the requested output

The Application does not permanently store credit card data

No processed data is retained beyond the execution of the user-initiated workflow, unless explicitly configured by the user

5. Data Sharing

The Application does not sell, rent, or share user data with third parties

Data may be transmitted temporarily to third-party services only as required to execute user-configured workflows (for example, automation platforms or cloud processing services)

No data is shared for commercial purposes

6. Data Security

Reasonable technical and organisational measures are implemented to protect the information processed by the Application, including access controls and restricted processing scopes.

Users are responsible for ensuring that uploaded files do not contain information they do not wish to process.

7. User Control

Users retain full control over their data:

Files are provided voluntarily by the user

Access to connected services (such as Google services) can be revoked at any time via the user’s account security settings

Users may discontinue use of the Application at any time

8. Third-Party Services

The Application may interact with third-party platforms (such as automation or cloud services) solely to perform the user-requested processing. These services operate under their own privacy policies.

9. Changes to This Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated revision date.
